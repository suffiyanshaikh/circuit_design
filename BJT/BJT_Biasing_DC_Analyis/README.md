# Overview

A BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) biasing circuit is used to establish the desired DC operating point or bias point for the transistor. The biasing circuit sets the base current and voltage levels to ensure the transistor operates within its linear region for proper amplification or switching.

There are different types of BJT biasing circuits, including:

* Base Bias
* Collector Feedback Bias (Emitter Bias)
* Voltage Divider Bias
* Emitter Bias

The project contains the dc analysis of biasing circuits.All the analysis and simulation is carried out in LTspice software.
